TRIXEL TECHNOLOGIES: MASTER IDEA AND FEATURE BLUEPRINT
============================================================

The goal is to build a high-converting, cinematic landing page for Trixel Technologies that uses a highly intelligent AI and synchronized animation to deliver a guided sales pitch, built exclusively using client-side technologies.

--- I. CORE ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRAINTS ---

**1. Development Stack:**
* The website must be a **single, self-contained HTML file** using only **HTML, CSS (Tailwind via CDN), and JavaScript (GSAP via CDN)**.
* **Aesthetics:** Uses a **Dark Mode, High-Tech, Cinematic** theme.

**2. Storage and Data (Critical Constraints):**
* **No Backend Systems:** The use of Firebase or any external database is strictly **forbidden**.
* **No Caching/Offline:** Service Workers and file caching are **removed**. The application is focused solely on the online, single-session experience.
* **Minimal Client-Side Storage:** Only essential, simple user settings (e.g., last selected music track) are saved using **browser `localStorage`**.

**3. Content Management System (CMS):**
* All static text content, features, service details, and audio sources must be defined within a centralized **JavaScript object (`const CMS_DATA`)** inside the HTML file.

**4. SEO and Structure:**
* The website must be SEO optimized with **Semantic HTML5** (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`), optimized `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.
* **Constraint:** Pricing information must be **explicitly omitted** from all content sections.

--- II. AUDIO AND CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE ---

**5. Single Audio Channel Mandate (CRITICAL):**
* **Only one `<audio>` element** is allowed on the entire website. This player must dynamically switch between the Voice Tour track and the Background Music track.
* **Audio Sources:**
    * **Main Voice Tour:** A single, comprehensive, pre-recorded audio file delivers the primary sales pitch.
    * **Background Music:** **Multiple selectable tracks** will be defined in the CMS for the user to cycle through.

**6. Sound Conflict Prevention:**
* **Rule:** The AI must use **Text-Only responses**. No Text-to-Speech (TTS) or synthesized voice responses are allowed.
* The single audio player must be **paused and muted** when the AI Chat modal is opened to ensure absolute silence and user focus on the text response.

**7. Optional Voice Tour:**
* A **Welcome Overlay** prompts the user to either **Start Tour** (activates voiceover and synchronization) or **Browse Silently** (activates music only).

**8. Animation and Synchronization:**
* All motion is handled exclusively by **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**.
* A **GSAP Timeline** is precisely mapped to the **Voice Tour audio time** to control scrolling and element reveals.
* User scrolling and interaction are **blocked** during the active Voice Tour.

--- III. INTELLIGENT AI AND INTERACTION ---

**9. Highly Intelligent Text AI (Assistant AI Orb):**
* **Technology:** Uses the **Gemini API** for sophisticated text generation.
* **Intelligence:** The AI must use a detailed **System Instruction** (loaded from `CMS_DATA`) to ensure it provides professional, contextually smart, and non-repetitive **text-only** answers.

**10. Restricted AI Access (High-Conversion Focus):**
* The interactive buttons (**"Ask Question," "Explanation," and "Order for This"**) that trigger the Assistant AI Orb are **only visible and interactive** within the **Service Sections** and the **"White True Streaks" future sections**.

**11. General AI Chat:**
* A separate, text-based chat modal provides access to the AI Assistant for general inquiries.

--- IV. WEBSITE STRUCTURE AND CONTROLS ---

**12. Required Content Sections:**
* Navbar, Hero, Feature Cards, Services, **User Reviews Section**, and Footer.

**13. Simplified Control Buttons (CRITICAL):**
* A fixed, persistent cluster of only **three** buttons must be visible:
    1.  **AI Chatbot:** Toggles the visibility of the General AI Chat modal.
    2.  **Audio:** Toggles the Play/Pause state of the currently active audio (Tour or Music).
    3.  **Back to Top:** Scrolls the user immediately to the top of the page.

**14. User Reviews Feature:**
* A dedicated UI section with a form for review submission (rating and text).
* **Mock Functionality:** Submissions are confirmed visually to the user, but the data is **logged to the browser console/`localStorage`** as a placeholder for a real-world API endpoint.
